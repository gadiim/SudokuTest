## Description
A Node.js application for validating Sudoku solutions by ensuring each row, column, and 3x3 block contains unique values and no zeros.

### Key Features:
- Validates Sudoku solutions for unique values in rows, columns, and blocks.
- Ensures no zeros are present in the final Sudoku grid.
- Modular and easily extendable for additional functionality.
- Simple and intuitive API for checking Sudoku grids.

## Task
You can find the task details [here](https://github.com/gadiim/SudokuTest/blob/main/TASK.md).

## Technologies Used
- Node.js
- JavaScript (ES6 Modules)

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites 
- Node.js installed on your machine.
- 
### Installation 
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sudokutest.git.
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd sudokutest
   ```

## Usage
To validate Sudoku solutions, run the following command:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
This will execute the script to check the Sudoku grids defined in the `validArray.js` and `invalidArray.js` files.

## Function Descriptions
<details><summary><strong>getUniqueValues()</strong>: Returns an array of unique values from the input array.</summary>

```javascript
   function getUniqueValues(arr) {
       return [...new Set(arr)];
   }
```
</details>
- `findZeros()`: Checks if there are any zeros in the Sudoku grid.
- `hasUniqueRows()`: Checks if each row in the Sudoku grid contains unique values.
- `hasUniqueColumns()`: Checks if each column in the Sudoku grid contains unique values.
- `hasUniqueBlocks()`: Checks if each 3x3 block in the Sudoku grid contains unique values.
- `validSolution()`: Combines all checks (rows, columns, blocks, and zeros) to validate the Sudoku solution.
